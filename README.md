<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
Project to better understand Active Directory and its functions. I used a script that can be found <a href="https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS">Here</a> to generate over a thousand Users. With all those users, I went ahead and assigned access permissions, groups, and organizational Units. Deleting and adding users as needed. Also cant forget the inevitable password reset! I'm running <b>Server 2019 </b> on <b>Oracle VirtualBox</b> as my enviroment.

  <br>Since I have not done or managed any OUs outside of my home lab, I found it better to put them directly into the domain. It was easier to access and manage for myself. Again, not saying its the proper place or the wrong place. Just found it easier.

  <br>In each OU I added different groups to manage. I Used the term Level 1, Level 2, etc. I meant it in terms of security access.

<h2>05/25/2022 Update</h2>
<br>
I added a good 10 users to each group. I need to look into a better way of doing it, as I feel adding one at a time is not productive. My next step is to great and manage group policies!
